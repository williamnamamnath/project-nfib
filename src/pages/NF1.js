            <p>NFIB, also known as <b>neurofibromatosis</b>, contains 3 conditions: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease, Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and Schwannomatosis (SWN).</p>
            
            <br/>
            <p>At the Montreal University Health Centre, the genetics department specializes with <b>Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) </b>, which is a genetic condition that causes changes in skin pigment and tumors on nerve tissue. Skin changes include flat, light brown spots and freckles in the armpits and groin. Tumors can grow anywhere in the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and nerves. NF1 is rare. About 1 in 2,500 is affected by NF1.
                <br/>
                <br/>
            The tumors often are not cancerous, known as benign tumors. But sometimes they can become cancerous. Symptoms often are mild. But complications can occur and may include trouble with learning, heart and blood vessel conditions, vision loss, and pain.
                <br/>
                <br/>
            Treatment focuses on supporting healthy growth and development in children and early management of complications. If NF1 causes large tumors or tumors that press on a nerve, surgery can reduce symptoms. A newer medicine is available to treat tumors in children, and other new treatments are being developed.</p>

                <H2>Symptoms</H2>
                <br/>
            <p>Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) usually is diagnosed during childhood. Symptoms are seen at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Symptoms tend to be mild to moderate, but they can vary from person to person.
                <br/>
                <br/>
            <h3>Symptoms include:</h3>
            <br/>
            <List>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <b>Flat, light brown spots on the skin, known as cafe au lait spots. </b>These harmless spots are common in many people. But having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They often are present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                <b>Freckling in the armpits or groin area. </b>Freckling often appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                <b>Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye, known as Lisch nodules. </b>These nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                <b>Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin called neurofibromas. </b>These benign tumors usually grow in or under the skin but can also grow inside the body. A growth that involves many nerves is called a plexiform neurofibroma. Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                <b>Bone changes. </b>Changes in bone development and low bone mineral density can cause bones to form in an irregular way. People with NF1 may have a curved spine, known as scoliosis, or a bowed lower leg.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                <b>Tumor on the nerve that connects the eye to the brain, called an optic pathway glioma. </b>This tumor usually appears by age 3. The tumor rarely appears in late childhood and among teenagers, and almost never in adults.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                <b>Learning disabilities. </b>It's common for children with NF1 to have some trouble with learning. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as trouble with reading or math. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                <b>Larger than average head size. </b>Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                <b>Short stature. </b>Children who have NF1 often are below average in height.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <H2>Treatment</H2>
            <br/>
            There isn't a cure for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), but symptoms can be managed. Generally, the sooner someone is under the care of a specialist trained in treating NF1, the better the outcome.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <H3>Monitoring</H3>
            <br/>
            If your child has NF1, often yearly age-appropriate checkups are recommended to:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <List>

            <ul>
                <li>Check your child's skin for new neurofibromas or changes in existing ones.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                Check for signs of high blood pressure.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                Check your child's growth and development. This includes measuring height, weight and head circumference to compare to growth charts for children who have NF1.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                Look for signs of early puberty.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                Look for any skeletal changes.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                Check your child's learning development and progress in school.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                Get a complete eye exam.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </List>
            <br/>
            Contact your healthcare team right away if you notice any changes in symptoms between visits. Many complications of NF1 can be treated effectively if therapy starts early.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <H3>Medicine</H3>
            <br/>
            <b>Selumetinib (Koselugo) </b>is a treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for plexiform neurofibroma in children. The medicine can shrink the size of a tumor. Clinical trials of similar medicines are currently being done for children and adults.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <H3>Surgery and other procedures</H3>
            <br/>
            Surgery to remove tumors may be needed to treat serious symptoms or complications of NF1. Symptoms can be relieved by removing all or part of tumors that are compressing nearby tissue or damaging organs.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <H3>Cancer treatment</H3>
            <br/>
            Cancers related to NF1 are treated with standard cancer therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Early diagnosis and treatment are the most important factors for a good outcome.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <H3>Potential future treatments</H3>
            <br/>
            Researchers are testing gene therapies for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Potential new treatments could include replacing the NF1 gene to restore the function of neurofibromin.
